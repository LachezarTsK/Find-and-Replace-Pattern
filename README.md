# Find-and-Replace-Pattern
Challenge at LeetCode.com. Tags: Hash Table, String, Array.


- Java | C++: applying Array instead of HashMap, which streamlines the code.

- JavaScript: applying HashMap is still the better option for this particular problem. Since JavaScript doesn't have an implicit conversion             
from char to ASCII code point, additional code is needed for an explicit conversion.
