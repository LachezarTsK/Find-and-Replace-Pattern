# Find-and-Replace-Pattern
Challenge at LeetCode.com. Tags: Hash Table, String, Array.


- Java | C++: applying Array instead of HashMap, which streamlines the code.

- Javascript: applying HashMap is still the better option for this particular problem. Since JavaScript doesn't have automatic conversion 
            from char to ascii code point, additional code is needed for an explicit conversion.
